The Final Game project presents an innovative blend of trivia and adventure, transforming a conventional quiz format into an exciting quest. Central to this experience is the integration of mythical monsters within the "Trivia_game" database. This database meticulously catalogs each monster's name, along with a unique trivia question, a set of possible answers, the correct answer, and an attack value. The gameplay mechanics are straightforward yet engaging. Players, identified by his/her names and health values, embark on a journey where they encounter these monsters. The encounter process is driven by a dice roll, determining which monster a player must face. Upon confrontation, the player is posed with a trivia question. Successfully answering the question allows the player to proceed unscathed, rewarding them with one point. However, failure to answer correctly results in an attack from the monster, diminishing the player's health.

The ultimate goal of The Final Game is to safeguard a peaceful kingdom from looming threats. Victory requires the player to correctly answer six questions. However, there is a catch: the player must maintain their health points above or equal a threshold of 25. This delicate balance of knowledge, strategy, and luck makes the game  a unique and captivating experience for players seeking a novel trivia challenge.
